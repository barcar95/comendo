## Project One: Recipe Application Description
We were tasked with creating a website that utilizes two APIs. We decided to create a recipe search website that gave a random cocktail when a recipe was clicked on. It takes in both ingrediants and recipe names to return search results as well as store favorited recipes in local storage for the user to come back and look at later.
